This is an attempt at migrating some rules from a popular board game into a browser game.

Things that need doing game wise

- dice option
- movement phase
- shooting phase
- hand to hand combat phase
- scenery
  - randomize scenery
  - restrict movement
  - restrict vision (raycasting)

Thing that need doing technically:
- set up js files as proper modules
- abstract html out into mustache

Things a way off
- persistance of players/ accounts (REST)
- persistence of games (REST)
- remote viewing of games
- real time games
- delayed games (like scrabble)
