This is an attempt at migrating some rules from a popular board game into a browser game.

Things that need doing game wise

- movement phase
- shooting phase
- hand to hand combat phase
- scenery
  - randomize scenery
  - restrict movement
  - restrict vision (raycasting)

Thing that need doing technically:
- set up js files as proper modules

Things a way off
- persistance of players/ accounts (REST)
- persistence of games (REST)
- remote viewing of games
- real time games
- delayed games (like scrabble)

Turn order:

Start player turn
  Movement:
    for each ganger
      select ganger, 
      move ganger, 
      turn ganger.
    lock gangers in place
    end phase
  Shooting
    for each ganger
      select ganger, 
      choose target in range,
      roll to hit target
      roll to wound target
      inflict damage on target,
    end phase
  Close combat
    for each ganger
      if touching
        combat turns
end player turn
